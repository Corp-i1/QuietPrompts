1. Project Structure & Template Choice
-	Recommended Template:
For a NuGet package intended for use in other projects, the Class Library template is the correct choice.
-	If you want to support WPF/XAML-based popups (for richer UI), use the WPF Class Library template.
-	For WinForms, use the Windows Forms Class Library.
-	For maximum compatibility, you can use a standard Class Library and reference WPF/WinForms as needed.
---
2. Core Design Principles
-	Intuitive API:
-	Use static helper methods for common prompt types (e.g., QuietPrompts.Prompt.Error(...)).
-	Allow fluent configuration for advanced customization (e.g., new Prompt().WithTitle(...).WithButton(...).Show()).
-	Customization:
-	Expose all visual and behavioral aspects via properties or builder methods.
-	Provide sensible defaults for quick use.
---
3. Implementation Plan
A. Prompt Model
-	Create a PromptOptions class to encapsulate all customizable properties:
-	Icon (image or enum)
-	Title bar visibility
-	Window title
-	Main title
-	Main text (with color markup support)
-	Sound (none, system, or custom)
-	Buttons (list of button definitions: text, color, action)
-	Background/foreground colors
B. Prompt Window
-	Implement a WPF Window (or WinForms Form) that:
-	Binds to PromptOptions
-	Dynamically generates buttons and applies styles/colors
-	Supports hiding the title bar, custom icons, etc.
-	Parses color markup in text (e.g., <red>text</red>)
C. API Surface
-	Static Methods for Common Prompts:
```
	QuietPrompts.Prompt.Error(string text, string? title = null, PromptOptions? options = null)
	QuietPrompts.Prompt.Warning(...)
	QuietPrompts.Prompt.Info(...)
```
-	Fluent/Builder API for Advanced Use:
```
var prompt = new Prompt()
      .WithTitle("Custom")
      .WithIcon(MyIcon)
      .WithButton("OK", color: Colors.Green)
      .WithButton("Cancel", color: Colors.Red)
      .WithText("Are you sure?");
  prompt.Show();
```

D. Customization Features
-	Sound:
-	Play no sound, system sound, or custom sound file.
-	Title Bar:
-	Toggle visibility via options.
-	Icons:
-	Allow built-in or custom icons.
-	Text Markup:
-	Parse simple color tags in main text.
-	Buttons:
-	Support any number, custom text, color, and actions.
E. Ease of Use
-	Provide extension methods or static helpers for the most common scenarios.
-	Document all options with clear XML comments for IntelliSense.
-	Include usage examples in the NuGet package README.
---
4. Packaging & Distribution
-	Ensure all resources (icons, sounds) are embedded or easily referenced.
-	Mark the package as compatible with .NET 8 and WPF (or WinForms) in the .csproj.
-	Include a README and usage samples in the NuGet package.
---
5. Next Steps
1.	Decide on WPF or WinForms for the UI layer.
WPF is recommended for richer customization and modern UI.
2.	Set up the class library project.
3.	Implement the PromptOptions and core window.
4.	Build the static and fluent APIs.
5.	Test and document.

Template Recommendation:
-	Use WPF Class Library for best UI flexibility.
-	If you want to support both WPF and WinForms, consider abstracting the UI layer, but start with WPF for simplicity.
